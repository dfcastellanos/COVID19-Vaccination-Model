# Statistical model of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign

(NOTE: an **interactive web App** version of this model can be found [here](https://covid19-vaccination-app.davidfcastellanos.com))

This **statistical model** reproduces the characteristics of the evolution of the ongoing COVID-19 **vaccination campaign** in specific countries. With it, the user can test the effects of different vaccine production and **delivery rates**, the segmentation of the population into **pro- and anti-vaccines**, and the impact of **social pressure** on non-vaccinated people. Moreover, the model can handle uncertainty in the parameters, allowing the user to consider **worst and best-case scenarios**.

This is an example of the model results, in this case optimized to reproduce the vaccination campaign in USA between the beginning of the campaign till the end of 2021:

The model results are shown in blue, where the shaded region contains 95% of the sampled data. The results are optimized to reproduce the USA vaccination campaign (in red). The real-world data is obtained from Our World in Data.

## Motivation
Vaccination campaigns can be regarded as relatively simple to model from a statistical perspective. One reason is that vaccination campaigns typically proceed as designed by professionals, away from the media, and supported by a great deal of experience accumulated from years of repetition. In these conditions, **sociological factors** are expected to play a minor role. However, these conditions do not entirely hold in the case of COVID-19 for several reasons:

-   Society is **fully aware** of the process, arguably drawing the biggest mediatic attention.    
-   Society is **fragmented** into groups with different views on vaccines, trying to influence each other's opinions.    
-   The vaccines are produced, delivered, and applied almost in real-time, so the vaccination dynamics must be coupled with **production and delivery dynamics**.    
-   The **uncertainty in the conditions** under which the vaccination is going to take place in a fastly evolving scenario of competition between countries and new virus variants
    
These points are the main reasons that make the COVID-19 vaccination campaign special from a statistical modeling perspective.  

## The model
The model and the sampling procedure are explained in detail in `assets/model_explanation.html`.


## Command-line interface

The commands are:

	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --pro PRO             comma-separated upper and lower bounds for the probability that a certain person belongs to the pro-vaccines group
	  --anti ANTI           comma-separated upper and lower bounds for the probability that a specific person belongs to the anti-vaccines group
	  --pressure PRESSURE   comma-separated upper and lower bounds for the strength of the social pressure effect
	  --dupl_time DUPL_TIME
	                        comma-separated upper and lower bounds for the duplication time of the weekly arriving vaccines
	  --init_stock INIT_STOCK
	                        comma-separated upper and lower bounds for the initial stock of vaccines, measured as a percentage of the population size
	  --max_delivery MAX_DELIVERY
	                        comma-separated upper and lower bounds for the maximum weekly delivery capacity, measured as a percentage over the population size
	  --mc_samples MC_SAMPLES
	                        number of Monte Carlo samples (optional)
	  --date_range DATE_RANGE
	                        comma-separated starting and ending dates
	  --CI CI               value of the quantile used for establishing the confidence intervals (optional)

This example call reproduces the results shown in the picture above:
	
	python model.py --pro=35,45 --anti=12,25 --pressure=0.,0.02 --dupl_time=5,7 --init_stock=1,1.2 --max_delivery=5,10 --date_range=2020-12-15,2022-07-1
