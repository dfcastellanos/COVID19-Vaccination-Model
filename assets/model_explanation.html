<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Vaccination
campaigns can be regarded as relatively <strong>simple processes to
model</strong> from a statistical perspective. One reason is that
vaccination campaigns typically proceed as designed by professionals,
away from the media, and supported by a great deal of experience
accumulated from years of repetition. In this conditions,
<strong>sociological factors</strong> are expected to play a minor
role. However, these conditions do not entirely hold in the case of
COVID-19 for several reasons:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Society is <strong>fully aware</strong>
	of the process, arguably drawing the biggest mediatic attention. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Society is <strong>fragmented</strong>
	into groups with different views on vaccines, trying to influence
	each other's opinions. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The vaccines are produced,
	delivered, and applied almost in real-time, so the vaccination
	dynamics must be coupled with <strong>production and delivery
	dynamics</strong>. 
	</p>
	<li><p>The <strong>uncertainty in the conditions</strong> under
	which the vaccination is going to take place in a fastly evolving
	scenario of competition between countries and new virus variants 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>These points are the main reasons that make the COVID-19
vaccination campaign special from a statistical modeling perspective.
In this post, I propose a <strong>statistical model</strong> to
capture the <strong>main characteristics</strong> of the evolution of
the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign in specific countries. With
this model, users can test the effects of different vaccine
production and delivery rates, the segmentation of the population
into pro- and anti-vaccines, and the impact of social pressure on
non-vaccinated people. Moreover, the approach naturally allows
considering the uncertainty in the model parameters, allowing users
to <strong>forecast worst and best-case scenarios</strong>.</p>

<h2>The model</h2>

<h3>Population segments</h3>

<p>We consider a population of size $N$ <strong>segmented into three
groups</strong>, depending on their views on vaccines:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Pro-vaccines:</strong>
	they take the vaccine as soon as they have the chance 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Anti-vaccines:</strong>
	they will never take a vaccine 
	</p>
	<li><p><strong>Agnostics:</strong> they initially hesitate, but
	given enough social pressure, they will take it 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>The size of each group is given by $n_{\rm pro} &lt; N$, $n_{\rm
anti} &lt; N$ and $n_{\rm agnos} &lt; N$, with $n_{\rm pro}+n_{\rm
anti}+n_{\rm agnos}=N$. We will denote the <strong>number of
vaccinated people</strong> by $n_{\rm vacc}$ and the number of <strong>people
currently waiting for a dosis</strong> by $n_{\rm wait}$. The latter
refers to people who want to be vaccinated but didn't have yet.</p>

<h3>Vaccination dynamics</h3>

<p>The following three steps are <strong>applied</strong> <strong>daily</strong>:</p>

<h4>1. Production and delivery of new doses</h4>
<p>The <strong>day number</strong> $t$ is increased by a unit, $t
\leftarrow t+1$. The <strong>first day of each week</strong>, the
number of newly <strong>arriving vaccines</strong> $\Delta n_{\rm
stock}$ is computed as</p>
<p>\[\Delta n_{\rm stock}(t) = n_{\rm stock,0} \cdot
\textrm{exp}\left( -\frac{t}{\tau}\frac{\textrm{log}(2)}{7} \right)
\]</p>
<p>where $\Delta n_{\rm stock}$ <strong>grows</strong> <strong>exponentially</strong>
with $t$ to meet a very high demand. In this expression, $n_{\rm
stock,0}$ is the number of doses in stock at the begining of the
campaign. The factor $\textrm{log}(2)/7$ in this expressions means
that $\tau$ is the duplication time in weeks (i.e., the number weeks
it takes for the production of vaccines to increase by a factor of
two, $\Delta n_{\rm stock}(t^{\prime}) = 2\Delta n_{\rm stock}(t)$ if
$t^{\prime} = t+7\tau$). Since $\Delta n_{\rm stock}$ cannot grow
indefinitely, it is throttled at a <strong>maximum weekly delivery
capacity</strong> $\Delta n_{\rm max}$. Thus,
\[\Delta n_{\rm stock} \leftarrow \textrm{min} \{ \Delta n_{\rm stock}, \Delta n_{\rm max} \}\]</p>
<p>The number of <strong>doses in stock</strong>, $n_{\rm stock}$ is
then updated as</p>

<p>\[n_{\rm stock} \leftarrow n_{\rm stock} + \Delta n_{\rm stock}\]</p>

<h4>2. Vaccination of people that is waiting for it</h4>
<p>The n<strong>umber of people vaccinated in one day</strong>,
$\Delta n_{\rm vacc}$ is a Poisson random variable with parameter
$\lambda = n_{\rm wait} \cdot p_{\rm avail}$, where $p_{\rm avail} =
(2/7) n_{\rm stock} / N$ is the probability that a person has the
vaccine available. The factor 2/7 accounts for vaccinations occurring
only two days a week, giving an <strong>effective per-day
probability</strong>. We must take into account that the number of
vaccines applied on a day cannot exceed the number of doses in stock
nor the number of people currently waiting to be vaccinated, thus</p>
<p>\[ \Delta n_{\rm vacc} \leftarrow \textrm{min} \{ \Delta n_{\rm
vacc}, n_{\rm stock}, n_{\rm wait} \} \]</p>
<p>Then, the number of vaccinated persons, vaccines in stock and
people currently waiting for a vaccine are updated
as,
\begin{align*}
n_{\rm vacc} &amp;\leftarrow n_{\rm
vacc}+\Delta n_{\rm vacc} \\
n_{\rm stock} &amp;\leftarrow
n_{\rm stock}-\Delta n_{\rm vacc}\\
n_{\rm wait} &amp;\leftarrow
n_{\rm wait}-\Delta n_{\rm vacc}
\end{align*}</p>

<h4>3. Social pressure on the agnostics</h4>

<p>The number of agnostic people that <strong>change their mind</strong>
and decide to get vaccinated, $\Delta n_{\rm agnos}$, is a Poisson
random variable with parameter $\lambda = n_{\rm agnos} \cdot p_{\rm
change}$. The probability $p_{\rm change}$ is that of an agnostic
person changing their mind during a day, and is approximated by
$p_{\rm change} = \rho \cdot n_{\rm vacc}/N$. The term $n_{\rm
vacc}/N$ acts as a proxy for <strong>social pressure</strong>.
Specifically, the higher the fraction of the vaccinated population,
the higher the pressure on the agnostics to do the same. The factor
$\rho$ allows tuning the strength of this effect. The value of $\rho$
emerges from complex social dynamics beyond the scope of this model.
Thus, its value can only be determined during a model training step.
We must take into account that the number of conversions cannot
overcome the current number of agnostics, thus
\[ \Delta n_{\rm agnos} \leftarrow \textrm{min} \{ \Delta n_{\rm agnos}, n_{\rm agnos} \} \]
Then, the number of agnostics and waiting people
are updated as,
\begin{align*}
n_{\rm agnos} &amp;\leftarrow
n_{\rm agnos}-\Delta n_{\rm agnos} \\
n_{\rm wait} &amp;\leftarrow
n_{\rm wait}+\Delta n_{\rm agnos}
\end{align*}</p>

<h3>Initial values</h3>
<p>The values of the variables during the first day, i.e., at $t=0$
are,
\begin{align*}
n_{\rm vacc} &amp;= 0\\
n_{\rm
stock} &amp;= n_{\rm stock,0}\\
n_{\rm wait} &amp;= n_{\rm
pro}\\
n_{\rm agnos} &amp;= |n_{\rm pro}-n_{\rm
anti}|
\end{align*}</p>

<h2>Sampling the model</h2>

<p>The model is <strong>sampled</strong> <strong>a number</strong>
$N_{\rm samples}$ of times, where each sample corresponds to applying
the three steps above until reaching a maximum number of days. The
model's <strong>free parameters</strong> are the initial stock of
vaccines $n_{\rm stock,0}$, the vaccines duplication time in weeks
$\tau$, the maximum weekly delivery capacity $\Delta n_{\rm max}$,
the prevalence of pro- and anti-vaccines, $p_{\rm pro}$ and $p_{\rm
anti}$ respectively, and the social pressure parameter $\rho$.</p>
<p>As discussed above, in a realistic situation, specifically during
the initial stages of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the
<strong>uncertainty in the model parameters</strong> can be
considerable. Moreover, even if reasonable estimations could be made,
it's still advisable to work with a range of values representing the
best and worst-case scenarios for the sake of safety. To include the
uncertainty in the parameters, we consider them as distributed
according to specific <strong>probability distributions</strong>.
Thus, for each simulated sample, we first draw the parameters from
these distributions. For simplicity, we consider each parameter as<strong>
uniformly distributed</strong> between an <strong>upper and a lower
bound</strong>, which are specific for each parameter. In order to
draw values of $p_{\rm pro}$ and $p_{\rm anti}$ such that $p_{\rm
pro} + p_{\rm anti} &lt; 1$, rejection sampling is used.</p>
<p>The value of the <strong>population size</strong> $N$ deserves
particular comment. $N$ must be set before sampling as a free
parameter. However, it does not necessarily need to mimic that of a
real country. For low $N$, the model will yield results with higher
across-sample variability. As $N$ increases, that variability drops.
If we aim at simulating a small population, the value of $N$ must be
set accordingly. However, suppose we simulate a country of millions
of citizens. In that case, the specific value of $N$ does not matter
much, as long as $N$ is big enough. A value of $N=50 000$ already
yields results similar to higher values. During the sampling
procedure, $N$ is the same for every sample.</p>
<p>After the $N_{\rm samples}$ samples have been completed, we
compute, for each day, the <strong>across-sample average</strong> of
different quantities. Specifically, we consider the fraction of the
population vaccinated, daily doses applied, the total number of doses
received by the country, and the current number of doses in stock.
Moreover, we also give <strong>confidence intervals</strong> for each
of these quantities by computing the across-sample $\alpha$ and
$1-\alpha$ quantiles.</p>
